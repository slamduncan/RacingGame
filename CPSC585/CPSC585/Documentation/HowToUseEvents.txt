To use the event system the following needs to be done:

Assumptions: Below the variable e will be used to represent a pointer to the EventSystemHandler.
		This can be easily gotten by doing the following:
			EventSystemHandler* e = EventSystemHandler::getInstance();


Case 1 - The event I want to observe or emit already exists:

   Case 1.1 - I want to emit / tell others that this event occurred.

		Event* ev = new MyEvent();
		e->emitEvent(ev);

   Case 1.2 - I want to observe an event:
		
		Create a MethodObserver<EVENT, CURRENTCLASS> object; 
		
			e.g. MethodObserver<ButtonEvent, TestClass> mo(this, &TestClass::testMethod);

		Create a Method in your class that takes in a pointer to the EVENT and returns void

			e.g. void testMethod(ButtonEvent *e);

		Register with the eventSystem handler in the following way:

			TestClass* testVar = new TestClass();
			EventSystemHandler::getInstance->addObserver(&((testVar)->methodObserverObject), EventTypes::BUTTON);


Case 2 - The event I want to Observe or Emit does not exitst:

	1 - Create a new class named MyClassNameEvent.
		e.g.
			ButtonEvent.cpp, and ButtonEvent.h

	2 - This new class must inherit from Event.
		e.g. 
			class ButtonEvent : public Event{}

	3 - Add the event to the enum inside of the EventTypes.h file.
		e.g. 	
			enum EventType {
				BUTTON,
				EVENTS_NUM		
			};

	4 - This new class must implement:  EventTypes::EventType getType();
		e.g. 
			EventTypes::EventType ButtonEvent::getType(){
				return EventTypes::BUTTON;
			}
		
	5 - The event is now created, see Case 1 for further instructions.
